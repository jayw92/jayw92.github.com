                My name is Jiayuan Wang, I prefer Jay. I was born near Shanghai, China on February 5, 1992.
                I moved to Germany when I was 5 years old and lived in Hanover and Berlin for two years.
                I attended 1st grade in Hanover and 2nd grade in Berlin. I did well in classes, to the
                teachers' surprise, and picked upspeaking  German in a month, and reading and writing in three.
                When November 2000 came around, I moved to Boston, Massachusetts and was placed in 3rd grade
                at the Lucy Stone School in Dorchester. I picked up English after 2 months
                and got the highest overall achievement award for my grade every year, which I was really
                proud of as a child. I made many friends at my elementary
                school and still remember their names and what they taught me to help me adapt to living in
                Dorchester.
              </p>
              <p>
                For 6th grade I went to the Richard J. Murphy School (also in Dorchester), where I first made
                friends with white kids; my elementary school was mostly African American and Hispanic.
                I learned swimming in that middle school and also started playing basketball, my favorite sport.
                It's something I can't do without even to this day. For 7th till 12th grade, I enrolled in the first high
                school that was created in the United States back in the colonial days. Boston Latin School, a public
                exam school known for rigorously preparing its students for graduation and college. Although
                there were some hard times in my six years at BLS, I have a lot of good memories of the school
                and now loved my time there, especially my four years of high school.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now, I am currently a student of Tufts University, Class of 2014. Tufts is home of the Jumbos, 
                our elephant mascot. My major is in Computer Science of the Engineering school. 
                I love the hilly Medford campus, the friendly students, and the passionate debates that define Tufts and who we are. 
                I've seen a lot of wonderful things and gained a plethora of knowledge in my 21 years, and I look forward to more amazing experiences in the future...
