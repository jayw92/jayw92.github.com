Hey there!
</p>
<p>
My name is Jay, I was born near Shanghai, China on February 5, 1992.
I moved to Germany when I was 5 years old and lived in Hanover and Berlin for two years.
I attended 1st grade in Hanover and 2nd grade in Berlin. I did well in classes, to the
teachers' surprise, and picked up German in a month and reading and writing in three.
When 2000 came around, I moved to Boston, Massachusetts and was placed in 3rd grade
at the Lucy Stone School in Dorchester that November. I picked up English after 2 months
and got the highest overall achievements at my school. I made many friends at my elementary
school and still remember their names and what they taught me to help me adapt to living in
Dorchester. 
</p>
<p>
For 6th grade I went to the Richard J. Murphy School, where I first made
friends with white kids, since my elementary school was mostly African American and Hispanic.
I learned swimming in middle school and also started playing basketball, my favorite sport 
which I can't do without till this day. For 7th till 12th grade I went to the first high
school that was created back in the colonial days of Boston, Boston Latin School, a public 
exam school known for rigorously preparing its students for graduation and college. Although
there were some hard times in my six years at BLS, I have a lot of good memories of the school
and came to love it, especially my high school years.
</p>
<p>
Right now, I am a current student of Tufts University class of 2014, home of the Jumbos 
(which I don't like to be called by people not from Tufts). My major is in Computer Science
of the Engineering school. I love the hilly Medford campus, the friendly students, and the 
passionate debates that define Tufts and who we are. I've see a lot of wonderful things and
gained much knowledge in my 20 years, and I look forward to more amazing experiences in the future...
